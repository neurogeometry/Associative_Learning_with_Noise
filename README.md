#Associative Learning in the Presence of Errors and Noise 

These functions generate the replica theoretical and numerical solutions for the biologically constrained, single-neuron associative learning model described in the manuscript by Chi Zhang, Danke Zhang, and Armen Stepanyants, “Structural and dynamical properties of cortical networks result from associative learning in the presence of errors and noise.”

The functions produce the results for both the homogeneous and heterogeneous cases considered in the manuscript. The functions work with MATLAB version R2017a or later.
